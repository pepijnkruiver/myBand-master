                <div class="abouttext"><p>Spawned from the muddy and windy Netherlands, 5 piece hardcore band 18 MILES is raging with their own furious, hard-hitting twist of modern hardcore. Known for their pumping energy and positive message 18 MILES has been breaking stages since 2010 all across Europe.</p>
        
        <p>When the band was formed, the band members lived in the smaller towns Uitgeest and Heerhugowaard. For this reason their band name was born. The distance between the separate members was 18 miles.</p>
            
            <p>At this moment 18 MILES has just released their second full length called ‘Revive’. Revive is fully produced by vocalist Daan Nieboer. This album came along with the second music video for the song ‘Die Strong’.</p>
